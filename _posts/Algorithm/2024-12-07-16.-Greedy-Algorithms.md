A greedy algorithm always makes the choice that looks best at the moment.
It makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally optimal solution.

## 16.1 An activity-selection problem

Suppose we have a set $$ S = \{ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \} $$ of $$ n $$ proposed activities that wish to use a resource.
Each activity $$ a_i $$ has a start time $$ s_i $$ and a finish time $$ f_i $$, where $$ 0 \le s_i < f_i < \infty $$.
If selected, activity $$ a_i $$ takes place during the half-open time interval $$ [s_i, \ f_i) $$.
Activities $$ a_i $$ and $$ a_j $$ are compatible if the intervals $$ [s_i, \ f_i) $$ and $$ [s_j, \ f_j) $$ do not overlap.
In the activity-selection problem, we wish to select a maximum-size subset of mutually compatible activities.
Assume that the activities are sorted in monotonically increasing order of finish time:

$$
\begin{align}
    f_1 \le f_2 \le \dots \le f_n
\end{align}
\label{eq:1}
\tag{16.1}
$$

### The optimal substructure of the activity-selection problem

Denote by $$ S_{ij} $$ the set of activities that start after activity $$ a_i $$ finishes and that finish before activity $$ a_j $$ starts.
Suppose $$ A_{ij} $$ is a maximum set of mutually compatible activities in $$ S_{ij} $$, which includes some activity $$ a_k $$.
We assume that $$ a_k $$ is included in an optimal solution.
Let $$ A_{ik} = A_{ij} \cap S_{ik} $$ and $$ A_{kj} = A_{ij} \cap S_{kj} $$, then it turns out that $$ A_{ij} = A_{ik} \cup \{ a_k \} \cup A_{kj} $$.
Therefore, $$ A_{ij} $$ consists of $$ |A_{ij}| = |A_{ik}| + |A_{kj}| + 1 $$ activities.

The cut-and-paste argument shows that the optimal solution $$ A_{ij} $$ includes optimal solutions to the two subproblems for $$ S_{ik} $$ and $$ S_{kj} $$.
Suppose there is a set $$ A'_{kj} $$ of mutually compatible activities in $$ S_{kj} $$ where $$ |A'_{kj}| > |A_{kj}| $$, then the equation below holds.

$$
\begin{align}
    |A_{ik}| + |A'_{kj}| + 1 &> |A_{ik}| + |A_{kj}| + 1 \\
                             &= |A_{ij}|
\end{align}
\label{eq:2}
\tag{16.2}
$$
