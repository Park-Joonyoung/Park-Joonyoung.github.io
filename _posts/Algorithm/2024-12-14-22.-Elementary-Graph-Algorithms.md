## 22.1 Representations of graphs

We can choose between two standard ways to represent a graph $$ G = (V, \ E) $$: as a collection of adjacency lists or as an adjacency matrix.
Adjacency-list representation provides a compact way to represent sparse graphs$$ \left( |E| \ll |V|^2 \right) $$.
Adjacency-matrix representation is more preferred when the graph is dense$$ \left( |E| \approx |V|^2 \right) $$ or when we need to tell quickly if there is an edge connecting two given vertices.

The adjacency-list representation of a graph $$ G = (V, \ E) $$ consists of an array $$ Adj $$ of $$ |V| $$ lists, one for each vertex in $$ V $$.
For each $$ u \in V $$, the adjacency list $$ Adj[u] $$ contains all the vertices $$ v $$ such that there is an edge $$ (u, \ v) \in E $$.
If $$ G $$ is a directed graph, the sum of the lenghts of all the adjacency lists is $$ |E| $$.
If $$ G $$ is an undirected graph, the sum of the lenghts of all the adjacency lists is $$ 2|E| $$.
For both directed and undirected graphs, the adjacency-list representation requires $$ \Theta (V + E) $$ amount of memory.

Adjacency lists are suitable for representing weighted graphs, that is, graphs for which each edge has an associated weight, typically given by a weight function $$ w : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $$.
We can simply store the weight $$ w(u, \ v) $$ of the edge $$ (u, \ v) \in E $$ with vertex $$ v $$ in $$ u $$'s adjacency list.
A potential disadvantage of the adjacency-list representation is that it provides no quicker way to determine whether a given edge $$ (u, \ v) $$ is present in the graph than to search for $$ v $$ in the adjacency list $$ Adj[u] $$.

The adjacency-matrix representation of a graph $$ G $$ consists of a $$ |V| \times |V| $$ matrix $$ A = (a_{ij}) $$ such that

$$
\begin{align*}
    a_{ij} = 
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if } (i, \ j) \in E \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$
